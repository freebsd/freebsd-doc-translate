"This document outlines the locking used in the FreeBSD kernel to permit "
"effective multi-processing within the kernel. Locking can be achieved via "
"several means. Data structures can be protected by mutexes or man:lockmgr[9] "
"locks. A few variables are protected simply by always using atomic "
"operations to access them."

"A mutex is simply a lock used to guarantee mutual exclusion. Specifically, a "
"mutex may only be owned by one entity at a time. If another entity wishes to "
"obtain a mutex that is already owned, it must wait until the mutex is "
"released. In the FreeBSD kernel, mutexes are owned by processes."

"Mutexes may be recursively acquired, but they are intended to be held for a "

"mutex. If you need to hold a lock across a sleep, use a man:lockmgr[9] lock."
