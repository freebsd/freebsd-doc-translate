"The FreeBSD operating system includes support for security event auditing. "
"Event auditing supports reliable, fine-grained, and configurable logging of "
"a variety of security-relevant system events, including logins, "
"configuration changes, and file and network access. These log records can be "
"invaluable for live system monitoring, intrusion detection, and postmortem "
"analysis. FreeBSD implements Sun(TM)'s published Basic Security Module (BSM) "
"Application Programming Interface (API) and file format, and is "
"interoperable with the Solaris(TM) and Mac OS(R) X audit implementations."

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"_event_: an auditable event is any event that can be logged using the audit "
"subsystem. Examples of security-relevant events include the creation of a "
"file, the building of a network connection, or a user logging in. Events are "
"either \"attributable\", meaning that they can be traced to an authenticated "
"user, or \"non-attributable\". Examples of non-attributable events are any "
"events that occur before authentication in the login process, such as bad "
"password attempts."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: documentation/content/en/books/handbook/audit/_index.adoc:79
msgid ""
"_class_: a named set of related events which are used in selection "
"expressions. Commonly used classes of events include \"file creation\" (fc), "
"\"exec\" (ex), and \"login_logout\" (lo)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: documentation/content/en/books/handbook/audit/_index.adoc:80
msgid ""
"_record_: an audit log entry describing a security event. Records contain a "
"record event type, information on the subject (user) performing the action, "
"date and time information, information on any objects or arguments, and a "
"success or failure condition."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: documentation/content/en/books/handbook/audit/_index.adoc:81
msgid ""
"_trail_: a log file consisting of a series of audit records describing "
"security events. Trails are in roughly chronological order with respect to "
"the time events completed. Only authorized processes are allowed to commit "
"records to the audit trail."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: documentation/content/en/books/handbook/audit/_index.adoc:82

"_selection expression_: a string containing a list of prefixes and audit "
"event class names used to match events."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: documentation/content/en/books/handbook/audit/_index.adoc:83
msgid ""
"_preselection_: the process by which the system identifies which events are "
"of interest to the administrator. The preselection configuration uses a "
"series of selection expressions to identify which classes of events to audit "
"for which users, as well as global settings that apply to both authenticated "
"and unauthenticated processes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: documentation/content/en/books/handbook/audit/_index.adoc:84
msgid ""
"_reduction_: the process by which records from existing audit trails are "
"selected for preservation, printing, or analysis. Likewise, the process by "
"which undesired audit records are removed from the audit trail. Using "
"reduction, administrators can implement policies for the preservation of "
"audit data. For example, detailed audit trails might be kept for one month, "
"but after that, trails might be reduced in order to preserve only login "
"information for archival purposes."

"It is easy to produce audit event feedback cycles, in which the viewing of "
"each audit event results in the generation of more audit events. For "
"example, if all network I/O is audited, and `praudit` is run from an SSH "
"session, a continuous stream of audit events will be generated at a high "
"rate, as each event being printed will generate another event. For this "
"reason, it is advisable to run `praudit` on an audit pipe device from "
"sessions without fine-grained I/O auditing."
