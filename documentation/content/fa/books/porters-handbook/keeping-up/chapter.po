"One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have already been "
"committed is by subscribing to "
"http://www.FreshPorts.org/[FreshPorts]. Multiple ports can be "
"monitored. Maintainers are strongly encouraged to subscribe, because they "
"will receive notification of not only their own changes, but also any "
"changes that any other FreeBSD committer has made. (These are often "
"necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying ports framework-although "
"it would be most polite to receive an advance heads-up from those committing "
"such changes, sometimes this is overlooked or impractical. Also, in some "
"cases, the changes are very minor in nature. We expect everyone to use their "
"best judgement in these cases.)"
