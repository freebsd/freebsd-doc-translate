"In the original days of computers, electronic text was simple. There were a "

"text, and what you saw really was what you got. No frills, no formatting, no "
"intelligence."

"Inevitably, this was not enough. When text is in a machine-usable format, "
"machines are expected to be able to use and manipulate it intelligently. "
"Authors want to indicate that certain phrases should be emphasized, or added "
"to a glossary, or made into hyperlinks. Filenames could be shown in a "
"“typewriter” style font for viewing on screen, but as “italics” when "
"printed, or any of a myriad of other options for presentation."
