"FreeBSD offers an excellent development environment. Compilers for C and C++ "
"and an assembler come with the basic system, not to mention classic UNIX(R) "
"tools such as `sed` and `awk`. If that is not enough, there are many more "
"compilers and interpreters in the Ports collection. The following section, "
"<<tools-programming,Introduction to Programming>>, lists some of the "
"available options. FreeBSD is very compatible with standards such as "
"POSIX(R) and ANSI C, as well with its own BSD heritage, so it is possible to "
"write applications that will compile and run with little or no modification "
"on a wide range of platforms."

"A program is a set of instructions that tell the computer to do various "

"when it performed a previous instruction. This section gives an overview of "
"the two main ways in which you can give these instructions, or \"commands\" "
"as they are usually called. One way uses an _interpreter_, the other a "
"_compiler_. As human languages are too difficult for a computer to "
"understand in an unambiguous way, commands are usually written in one or "

"With an interpreter, the language comes as an environment, where you type in "
"commands at a prompt and the environment executes them for you. For more "
"complicated programs, you can type the commands into a file and get the "
"interpreter to load the file and execute the commands in it. If anything "
"goes wrong, many interpreters will drop you into a debugger to help you "
"track down the problem."

"The advantage of this is that you can see the results of your commands "
"immediately, and mistakes can be corrected readily. The biggest disadvantage "
"comes when you want to share your programs with someone. They must have the "
"same interpreter, or you must have some way of giving it to them, and they "
"need to understand how to use it. Also users may not appreciate being thrown "
"into a debugger if they press the wrong key! From a performance point of "
"view, interpreters can use up a lot of memory, and generally do not generate "
"code as efficiently as compilers."
msgstr ""
"مزیت این امر این است که شما نتیجهٔ دستورات خود را فوراً مشاهده می‌کنید، و "
"اشتباهات را به‌راحتی می‌توانید اصلاح کنید. بزرگترین نقطه ضعف زمانی مشهود است "
"که شما می‌خواهید برنامهٔ خود را با کسی به اشتراک بذارید. ایشان باید همان "
"مفسر را داشته باشند، یا شما باید راهی برای تحویل آن داشته باشید، و ایشان "
"بدانند که چگونه از آن استفاده کنند. همچنین ممکن است کاربران علاقه‌ای به "
"هدایت شدن به یک اشکال‌زدا در صورت فشردن کلیدی اشتباه را نداشته باشند! از "
"منظر عملکرد، مفسرها می‌توانند حافظهٔ زیادی مصرف کنند، و به‌طور کلی کدی به "
"کارآمدی همگردان‌ها تولید نمی‌کنند."

"In my opinion, interpreted languages are the best way to start if you have "
"not done any programming before. This kind of environment is typically found "
"with languages like Lisp, Smalltalk, Perl and Basic. It could also be argued "
"that the UNIX(R) shell (`sh`, `csh`) is itself an interpreter, and many "
"people do in fact write shell \"scripts\" to help with various "
"\"housekeeping\" tasks on their machine. Indeed, part of the original "
"UNIX(R) philosophy was to provide lots of small utility programs that could "
"be linked together in shell scripts to perform useful tasks."
