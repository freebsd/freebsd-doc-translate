"ZFS is significantly different from any previous file system because it is "
"more than just a file system.  Combining the traditionally separate roles of "
"volume manager and file system provides ZFS with unique advantages.  The "
"file system is now aware of the underlying structure of the disks.  "
"Traditional file systems could only be created on a single disk at a time.  "
"If there were two disks then two separate file systems would have to be "
"created.  In a traditional hardware RAID configuration, this problem was "
"avoided by presenting the operating system with a single logical disk made "
"up of the space provided by a number of physical disks, on top of which the "
"operating system placed a file system.  Even in the case of software RAID "
"solutions like those provided by GEOM, the UFS file system living on top of "
"the RAID transform believed that it was dealing with a single device.  ZFS's "
"combination of the volume manager and the file system solves this and allows "
"the creation of many file systems all sharing a pool of available storage.  "
"One of the biggest advantages to ZFS's awareness of the physical layout of "
"the disks is that existing file systems can be grown automatically when "
"additional disks are added to the pool.  This new space is then made "
"available to all of the file systems.  ZFS also has a number of different "
"properties that can be applied to each file system, giving many advantages "
"to creating a number of different file systems and datasets rather than a "
"single monolithic file system."

"The checksums stored with data blocks enable the file system to _self-"

"For example, a mirror with two disks where one drive is starting to "
"malfunction and cannot properly store the data any more.  This is even worse "
"when the data has not been accessed for a long time, as with long term "
"archive storage.  Traditional file systems need to run algorithms that check "
"and repair the data like man:fsck[8].  These commands take time, and in "
"severe cases, an administrator has to manually decide which repair operation "
"must be performed.  When ZFS detects a data block with a checksum that does "
"not match, it tries to read the data from the mirror disk.  If that disk can "
"provide the correct data, it will not only give that data to the application "
"requesting it, but also correct the wrong data on the disk that had the bad "
"checksum.  This happens without any interaction from a system administrator "

"<<zfs-term-snapshot,Snapshots>> are one of the most powerful features of "
"ZFS.  A snapshot provides a read-only, point-in-time copy of the dataset.  "
"With Copy-On-Write (COW), snapshots can be created quickly by preserving the "
"older version of the data on disk.  If no snapshots exist, space is "
"reclaimed for future use when data is rewritten or deleted.  Snapshots "
"preserve disk space by recording only the differences between the current "
"dataset and a previous version.  Snapshots are allowed only on whole "
"datasets, not on individual files or directories.  When a snapshot is "
"created from a dataset, everything contained in it is duplicated.  This "
"includes the file system properties, files, directories, permissions, and so "
"on.  Snapshots use no additional space when they are first created, only "
"consuming space as the blocks they reference are changed.  Recursive "
"snapshots taken with `-r` create a snapshot with the same name on the "
"dataset and all of its children, providing a consistent moment-in-time "
"snapshot of all of the file systems.  This can be important when an "
"application has files on multiple datasets that are related or dependent "
"upon each other.  Without snapshots, a backup would have copies of the files "

"When at least one snapshot is available, it can be rolled back to at any "

"Luckily, rolling back a snapshot is just as easy as typing `zfs rollback "

"snapshot has been rolled back, the dataset has the same state as it had when "

"not part of the snapshot is discarded.  Taking a snapshot of the current "

"|ZFS uses an Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), rather than a more "
"traditional Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. An LRU cache is a simple list "
"of items in the cache, sorted by when each object was most recently used. "
"New items are added to the top of the list. When the cache is full, items "
"from the bottom of the list are evicted to make room for more active "
"objects. An ARC consists of four lists; the Most Recently Used (MRU) and "
"Most Frequently Used (MFU) objects, plus a ghost list for each. These ghost "
"lists track recently evicted objects to prevent them from being added back "
"to the cache. This increases the cache hit ratio by avoiding objects that "
"have a history of only being used occasionally. Another advantage of using "
"both an MRU and MFU is that scanning an entire file system would normally "
"evict all data from an MRU or LRU cache in favor of this freshly accessed "
"content. With ZFS, there is also an MFU that only tracks the most frequently "
"used objects, and the cache of the most commonly accessed blocks remains.  |"
"[[zfs-term-l2arc]]L2ARC |L2ARC is the second level of the ZFS caching "
"system. The primary ARC is stored in RAM. Since the amount of available RAM "
"is often limited, ZFS can also use <<zfs-term-vdev-cache,cache vdevs>>. "
"Solid State Disks (SSDs) are often used as these cache devices due to their "
"higher speed and lower latency compared to traditional spinning disks. L2ARC "
"is entirely optional, but having one will significantly increase read speeds "
"for files that are cached on the SSD instead of having to be read from the "
"regular disks. L2ARC can also speed up <<zfs-term-deduplication,"
"deduplication>> because a DDT that does not fit in RAM but does fit in the "
"L2ARC will be much faster than a DDT that must be read from disk. The rate "
"at which data is added to the cache devices is limited to prevent "
"prematurely wearing out SSDs with too many writes. Until the cache is full "
"(the first block has been evicted to make room), writing to the L2ARC is "
"limited to the sum of the write limit and the boost limit, and afterwards "
"limited to the write limit. A pair of man:sysctl[8] values control these "
"rate limits. <<zfs-advanced-tuning-l2arc_write_max,`vfs.zfs."
"l2arc_write_max`>> controls how many bytes are written to the cache per "
"second, while <<zfs-advanced-tuning-l2arc_write_boost,`vfs.zfs."
"l2arc_write_boost`>> adds to this limit during the \"Turbo Warmup Phase"
"\" (Write Boost).  |[[zfs-term-zil]]ZIL |ZIL accelerates synchronous "
"transactions by using storage devices like SSDs that are faster than those "
"used in the main storage pool. When an application requests a synchronous "
"write (a guarantee that the data has been safely stored to disk rather than "
"merely cached to be written later), the data is written to the faster ZIL "
"storage, then later flushed out to the regular disks. This greatly reduces "
"latency and improves performance. Only synchronous workloads like databases "
"will benefit from a ZIL. Regular asynchronous writes such as copying files "
"will not use the ZIL at all.  |[[zfs-term-cow]]Copy-On-Write |Unlike a "
"traditional file system, when data is overwritten on ZFS, the new data is "
"written to a different block rather than overwriting the old data in place. "
"Only when this write is complete is the metadata then updated to point to "
"the new location. In the event of a shorn write (a system crash or power "
"loss in the middle of writing a file), the entire original contents of the "
"file are still available and the incomplete write is discarded. This also "
"means that ZFS does not require a man:fsck[8] after an unexpected shutdown.  "
"|[[zfs-term-dataset]]Dataset |_Dataset_ is the generic term for a ZFS file "
"system, volume, snapshot or clone. Each dataset has a unique name in the "
"format _poolname/path@snapshot_. The root of the pool is technically a "
"dataset as well. Child datasets are named hierarchically like directories. "
"For example, _mypool/home_, the home dataset, is a child of _mypool_ and "
"inherits properties from it. This can be expanded further by creating "
"_mypool/home/user_. This grandchild dataset will inherit properties from the "
"parent and grandparent. Properties on a child can be set to override the "
"defaults inherited from the parents and grandparents. Administration of "
"datasets and their children can be <<zfs-zfs-allow,delegated>>.  |[[zfs-term-"
"filesystem]]File system |A ZFS dataset is most often used as a file system. "
"Like most other file systems, a ZFS file system is mounted somewhere in the "
"systems directory hierarchy and contains files and directories of its own "
"with permissions, flags, and other metadata.  |[[zfs-term-volume]]Volume |In "
"addition to regular file system datasets, ZFS can also create volumes, which "
"are block devices. Volumes have many of the same features, including copy-on-"
"write, snapshots, clones, and checksumming. Volumes can be useful for "
"running other file system formats on top of ZFS, such as UFS virtualization, "
"or exporting iSCSI extents.  |[[zfs-term-snapshot]]Snapshot |The <<zfs-term-"
"cow,copy-on-write>> (COW) design of ZFS allows for nearly instantaneous, "
"consistent snapshots with arbitrary names. After taking a snapshot of a "
"dataset, or a recursive snapshot of a parent dataset that will include all "
"child datasets, new data is written to new blocks, but the old blocks are "
"not reclaimed as free space. The snapshot contains the original version of "
"the file system, and the live file system contains any changes made since "
"the snapshot was taken. No additional space is used. As new data is written "
"to the live file system, new blocks are allocated to store this data. The "
"apparent size of the snapshot will grow as the blocks are no longer used in "
"the live file system, but only in the snapshot. These snapshots can be "
"mounted read only to allow for the recovery of previous versions of files. "
"It is also possible to <<zfs-zfs-snapshot,rollback>> a live file system to a "
"specific snapshot, undoing any changes that took place after the snapshot "
"was taken. Each block in the pool has a reference counter which keeps track "
"of how many snapshots, clones, datasets, or volumes make use of that block. "
"As files and snapshots are deleted, the reference count is decremented. When "
"a block is no longer referenced, it is reclaimed as free space. Snapshots "
"can also be marked with a <<zfs-zfs-snapshot,hold>>. When a snapshot is "
"held, any attempt to destroy it will return an `EBUSY` error. Each snapshot "
"can have multiple holds, each with a unique name. The <<zfs-zfs-snapshot,"
"release>> command removes the hold so the snapshot can deleted. Snapshots "
"can be taken on volumes, but they can only be cloned or rolled back, not "
"mounted independently.  |[[zfs-term-clone]]Clone |Snapshots can also be "
"cloned. A clone is a writable version of a snapshot, allowing the file "
"system to be forked as a new dataset. As with a snapshot, a clone initially "
"consumes no additional space. As new data is written to a clone and new "
"blocks are allocated, the apparent size of the clone grows. When blocks are "
"overwritten in the cloned file system or volume, the reference count on the "
"previous block is decremented. The snapshot upon which a clone is based "
"cannot be deleted because the clone depends on it. The snapshot is the "
"parent, and the clone is the child. Clones can be _promoted_, reversing this "
"dependency and making the clone the parent and the previous parent the "
"child. This operation requires no additional space. Since the amount of "
"space used by the parent and child is reversed, existing quotas and "
"reservations might be affected.  |[[zfs-term-checksum]]Checksum |Every block "
"that is allocated is also checksummed. The checksum algorithm used is a per-"
"dataset property, see <<zfs-zfs-set,`set`>>. The checksum of each block is "
"transparently validated as it is read, allowing ZFS to detect silent "
"corruption. If the data that is read does not match the expected checksum, "
"ZFS will attempt to recover the data from any available redundancy, like "
"mirrors or RAID-Z. Validation of all checksums can be triggered with <<zfs-"
"term-scrub,`scrub`>>. Checksum algorithms include:"

"tunable. If `dedup` is `on`, then a matching checksum is assumed to mean "
"that the data is identical. If `dedup` is set to `verify`, then the data in "
"the two blocks will be checked byte-for-byte to ensure it is actually "
"identical. If the data is not identical, the hash collision will be noted "
"and the two blocks will be stored separately. As DDT must store the hash of "
"each unique block, it consumes a very large amount of memory. A general rule "
"of thumb is 5-6 GB of ram per 1 TB of deduplicated data). In situations "
"where it is not practical to have enough RAM to keep the entire DDT in "
"memory, performance will suffer greatly as the DDT must be read from disk "
"before each new block is written. Deduplication can use L2ARC to store the "
"DDT, providing a middle ground between fast system memory and slower disks. "
"Consider using compression instead, which often provides nearly as much "
"space savings without the additional memory requirement.  |[[zfs-term-"
"scrub]]Scrub |Instead of a consistency check like man:fsck[8], ZFS has "
"`scrub`. `scrub` reads all data blocks stored on the pool and verifies their "
"checksums against the known good checksums stored in the metadata. A "
"periodic check of all the data stored on the pool ensures the recovery of "
"any corrupted blocks before they are needed. A scrub is not required after "
"an unclean shutdown, but is recommended at least once every three months. "
"The checksum of each block is verified as blocks are read during normal use, "
"but a scrub makes certain that even infrequently used blocks are checked for "
"silent corruption. Data security is improved, especially in archival storage "
"situations. The relative priority of `scrub` can be adjusted with <<zfs-"
"advanced-tuning-scrub_delay,`vfs.zfs.scrub_delay`>> to prevent the scrub "
"from degrading the performance of other workloads on the pool.  |[[zfs-term-"
"quota]]Dataset Quota a|ZFS provides very fast and accurate dataset, user, "
"and group space accounting in addition to quotas and space reservations. "
"This gives the administrator fine grained control over how space is "
"allocated and allows space to be reserved for critical file systems.  ZFS "
"supports different types of quotas: the dataset quota, the <<zfs-term-"
"refquota,reference quota (refquota)>>, the <<zfs-term-userquota,user "
"quota>>, and the <<zfs-term-groupquota,group quota>>.  Quotas limit the "
"amount of space that a dataset and all of its descendants, including "
"snapshots of the dataset, child datasets, and the snapshots of those "
"datasets, can consume."

"|[[zfs-term-refquota]]Reference Quota |A reference quota limits the amount "

"free space, at least 10 GB of space is reserved for this dataset. If a "
"snapshot is taken of [.filename]#storage/home/bob#, the space used by that "
"snapshot is counted against the reservation. The <<zfs-term-refreservation,"
"`refreservation`>> property works in a similar way, but it _excludes_ "
"descendants like snapshots.  Reservations of any sort are useful in many "
"situations, such as planning and testing the suitability of disk space "

"term-refreservation]]Reference Reservation |The `refreservation` property "

"this dataset. In contrast to a regular <<zfs-term-reservation,reservation>>, "
"space used by snapshots and descendant datasets is not counted against the "
"reservation. For example, if a snapshot is taken of [.filename]#storage/home/"
"bob#, enough disk space must exist outside of the `refreservation` amount "
"for the operation to succeed. Descendants of the main data set are not "
"counted in the `refreservation` amount and so do not encroach on the space "
