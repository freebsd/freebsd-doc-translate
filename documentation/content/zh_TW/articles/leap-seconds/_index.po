"The easiest way to handle leap seconds is with the POSIX time rules FreeBSD "
"uses by default, combined with extref:{handbook}[NTP, network-ntp].  When "
"man:ntpd[8] is running and the time is synchronized with upstream NTP "
"servers that handle leap seconds correctly, the leap second will cause the "
"system time to automatically repeat the last second of the day.  No other "
"adjustments are necessary."
