"The rapid pace of FreeBSD progress makes print media impractical as a means "
"of following the latest developments. Electronic resources are the best, if "
"not often the only, way to stay informed of the latest advances. Since "
"FreeBSD is a volunteer effort, the user community itself also generally "
"serves as a \"technical support department\" of sorts, with electronic mail, "
"web forums, and USENET news being the most effective way of reaching that "
"community."
