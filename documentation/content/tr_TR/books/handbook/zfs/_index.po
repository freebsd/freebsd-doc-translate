msgid ""
"More than a file system, ZFS is fundamentally different from traditional "
"file systems.  Combining the traditionally separate roles of volume manager "
"and file system provides ZFS with unique advantages.  The file system is now "
"aware of the underlying structure of the disks.  Traditional file systems "
"could exist on a single disk alone at a time.  If there were two disks then "
"creating two separate file systems was necessary.  A traditional hardware "
"RAID configuration avoided this problem by presenting the operating system "
"with a single logical disk made up of the space provided by physical disks "
"on top of which the operating system placed a file system.  Even with "
"software RAID solutions like those provided by GEOM, the UFS file system "
"living on top of the RAID believes it's dealing with a single device.  ZFS' "
"combination of the volume manager and the file system solves this and allows "
"the creation of file systems that all share a pool of available storage.  "
"One big advantage of ZFS' awareness of the physical disk layout is that "
"existing file systems grow automatically when adding extra disks to the "
"pool.  This new space then becomes available to the file systems.  ZFS can "
"also apply different properties to each file system. This makes it useful to "
"create separate file systems and datasets instead of a single monolithic "
"file system."

"<<zfs-term-snapshot,Snapshots>> are one of the most powerful features of "
"ZFS.  A snapshot provides a read-only, point-in-time copy of the dataset.  "
"With Copy-On-Write (COW), ZFS creates snapshots fast by preserving older "
"versions of the data on disk.  If no snapshots exist, ZFS reclaims space for "
"future use when data is rewritten or deleted.  Snapshots preserve disk space "
"by recording just the differences between the current dataset and a previous "
"version.  Allowing snapshots on whole datasets, not on individual files or "
"directories.  A snapshot from a dataset duplicates everything contained in "
"it.  This includes the file system properties, files, directories, "
"permissions, and so on.  Snapshots use no extra space when first created, "
"but consume space as the blocks they reference change.  Recursive snapshots "
"taken with `-r` create snapshots with the same name on the dataset and its "
"children, providing a consistent moment-in-time snapshot of the file "
"systems.  This can be important when an application has files on related "
"datasets or that depend upon each other.  Without snapshots, a backup would "
"have copies of the files from different points in time."

"When at least one snapshot is available, roll back to it at any time.  Most "

A mirror vdev can withstand the failure of all but one of its members without losing any data.\n"

ZFS supports three levels of RAID-Z which provide varying levels of redundancy in exchange for decreasing levels of usable storage. ZFS uses RAID-Z1 through RAID-Z3 based on the number of parity devices in the array and the number of disks which can fail before the pool stops  being operational.\n"

"+\n"
"In a RAID-Z3 configuration with eight disks of 1 TB, the volume will provide 5 TB of usable space and still be able to operate with three faulted disks. Sun(TM) recommends no more than nine disks in a single vdev. If more disks make up the configuration, the recommendation is to divide them into separate vdevs and stripe the pool data across them.\n"
"+\n"
"A configuration of two RAID-Z2 vdevs consisting of 8 disks each would create something like a RAID-60 array. A RAID-Z group's storage capacity is about the size of the smallest disk multiplied by the number of non-parity disks. Four 1 TB disks in RAID-Z1 has an effective size of about 3 TB, and an array of eight 1 TB disks in RAID-Z3 will yield 5 TB of usable space.\n"

"* [[zfs-term-vdev-log]] _Log_ - ZFS Log Devices, also known as ZFS Intent Log (<<zfs-term-zil,ZIL>>) move the intent log from the regular pool devices to a dedicated device, typically an SSD. Having a dedicated log device improves the performance of applications with a high volume of synchronous writes like databases. Mirroring of log devices is possible, but RAID-Z is not supported. If using a lot of log devices, writes will be load-balanced across them.\n"
"* [[zfs-term-vdev-cache]] _Cache_ - Adding a cache vdev to a pool will add the storage of the cache to the <<zfs-term-l2arc,L2ARC>>. Mirroring cache devices is impossible. Since a cache device stores only new copies of existing data, there is no risk of data loss."

Since allocating space for the data blocks generates new metadata, the syncing state cannot finish until a pass completes that does not use any new space. The syncing state is also where _synctasks_ complete. Synctasks are administrative operations such as creating or destroying snapshots and datasets that complete the uberblock change. Once the sync state completes the transaction group in the quiescing state advances to the syncing state. All administrative functions, such as <<zfs-term-snapshot,`snapshot`>> write as part of the transaction group.

An ARC consists of four lists; the Most Recently Used (MRU) and Most Frequently Used (MFU) objects, plus a ghost list for each. These ghost lists track evicted objects to prevent adding them back to the cache. This increases the cache hit ratio by avoiding objects that have a history of occasional use. Another advantage of using both an MRU and MFU is that scanning an entire file system would evict all data from an MRU or LRU cache in favor of this freshly accessed content. With ZFS, there is also an MFU that tracks the most frequently used objects, and the cache of the most commonly accessed blocks remains."

L2ARC is entirely optional, but having one will increase read speeds for cached files on the SSD instead of having to read from the regular disks.

msgid "Cloning a snapshot is also possible. A clone is a writable version of a snapshot, allowing the file system to fork as a new dataset. As with a snapshot, a clone initially consumes no new space. As new data written to a clone uses new blocks, the size of the clone grows. When blocks are overwritten in the cloned file system or volume, the reference count on the previous block decreases. Removing the snapshot upon which a clone bases is impossible because the clone depends on it. The snapshot is the parent, and the clone is the child. Clones can be _promoted_, reversing this dependency and making the clone the parent and the previous parent the child. This operation requires no new space. Since the amount of space used by the parent and child reverses, it may affect existing quotas and reservations."

msgid "Checksums make it possible to detect duplicate blocks when writing data. With deduplication, the reference count of an existing, identical block increases, saving storage space. ZFS keeps a deduplication table (DDT) in memory to detect duplicate blocks. The table contains a list of unique checksums, the location of those blocks, and a reference count. When writing new data, ZFS calculates checksums and compares them to the list. When finding a match it uses the existing block. Using the SHA256 checksum algorithm with deduplication provides a secure cryptographic hash. Deduplication is tunable. If `dedup` is `on`, then a matching checksum means that the data is identical. Setting `dedup` to `verify`, ZFS performs a byte-for-byte check on the data ensuring they are actually identical. If the data is not identical, ZFS will note the hash collision and store the two blocks separately. As the DDT must store the hash of each unique block, it consumes a large amount of memory. A general rule of thumb is 5-6 GB of ram per 1 TB of deduplicated data). In situations not practical to have enough RAM to keep the entire DDT in memory, performance will suffer greatly as the DDT must read from disk before writing each new block. Deduplication can use L2ARC to store the DDT, providing a middle ground between fast system memory and slower disks. Consider using compression instead, which often provides nearly as much space savings without the increased memory."

A scrub is not required after an unclean shutdown, but good practice is at least once every three months. ZFS verifies the checksum of each block during normal use, but a scrub makes certain to check even infrequently used blocks for silent corruption. ZFS improves data security in archival storage situations.
