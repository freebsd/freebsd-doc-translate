#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"ZFS is significantly different from any previous file system because it is "
"more than just a file system. Combining the traditionally separate roles of "
"volume manager and file system provides ZFS with unique advantages. The file "
"system is now aware of the underlying structure of the disks. Traditional "
"file systems could only be created on a single disk at a time. If there were "
"two disks then two separate file systems would have to be created. In a "
"traditional hardware RAID configuration, this problem was avoided by "
"presenting the operating system with a single logical disk made up of the "
"space provided by a number of physical disks, on top of which the operating "
"system placed a file system. Even in the case of software RAID solutions "
"like those provided by GEOM, the UFS file system living on top of the RAID "
"transform believed that it was dealing with a single device. ZFS's "
"combination of the volume manager and the file system solves this and allows "
"the creation of many file systems all sharing a pool of available storage. "
"One of the biggest advantages to ZFS's awareness of the physical layout of "
"the disks is that existing file systems can be grown automatically when "
"additional disks are added to the pool. This new space is then made "
"available to all of the file systems. ZFS also has a number of different "
"properties that can be applied to each file system, giving many advantages "
"to creating a number of different file systems and datasets rather than a "
"single monolithic file system."

"<<zfs-term-snapshot,Snapshots>> are one of the most powerful features of "
"ZFS. A snapshot provides a read-only, point-in-time copy of the dataset. "
"With Copy-On-Write (COW), snapshots can be created quickly by preserving the "
"older version of the data on disk. If no snapshots exist, space is reclaimed "
"for future use when data is rewritten or deleted. Snapshots preserve disk "
"space by recording only the differences between the current dataset and a "
"previous version. Snapshots are allowed only on whole datasets, not on "
"individual files or directories. When a snapshot is created from a dataset, "
"everything contained in it is duplicated. This includes the file system "
"properties, files, directories, permissions, and so on. Snapshots use no "
"additional space when they are first created, only consuming space as the "
"blocks they reference are changed. Recursive snapshots taken with `-r` "
"create a snapshot with the same name on the dataset and all of its children, "
"providing a consistent moment-in-time snapshot of all of the file systems. "
"This can be important when an application has files on multiple datasets "
"that are related or dependent upon each other. Without snapshots, a backup "
"would have copies of the files from different points in time."

"Snapshots in ZFS provide a variety of features that even other file systems "
"with snapshot functionality lack. A typical example of snapshot use is to "
"have a quick way of backing up the current state of the file system when a "
"risky action like a software installation or a system upgrade is performed. "
"If the action fails, the snapshot can be rolled back and the system has the "
"same state as when the snapshot was created. If the upgrade was successful, "
"the snapshot can be deleted to free up space. Without snapshots, a failed "
"upgrade often requires a restore from backup, which is tedious, time "
"consuming, and may require downtime during which the system cannot be used. "
"Snapshots can be rolled back quickly, even while the system is running in "
"normal operation, with little or no downtime. The time savings are enormous "
"with multi-terabyte storage systems and the time required to copy the data "
"from backup. Snapshots are not a replacement for a complete backup of a "
"pool, but can be used as a quick and easy way to store a copy of the dataset "
"at a specific point in time."

"|ZFS uses an Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), rather than a more "
"traditional Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. An LRU cache is a simple list "
"of items in the cache, sorted by when each object was most recently used. "
"New items are added to the top of the list. When the cache is full, items "
"from the bottom of the list are evicted to make room for more active "
"objects. An ARC consists of four lists; the Most Recently Used (MRU) and "
"Most Frequently Used (MFU) objects, plus a ghost list for each. These ghost "
"lists track recently evicted objects to prevent them from being added back "
"to the cache. This increases the cache hit ratio by avoiding objects that "
"have a history of only being used occasionally. Another advantage of using "
"both an MRU and MFU is that scanning an entire file system would normally "
"evict all data from an MRU or LRU cache in favor of this freshly accessed "
"content. With ZFS, there is also an MFU that only tracks the most frequently "
"used objects, and the cache of the most commonly accessed blocks remains.  |"
"[[zfs-term-l2arc]]L2ARC |L2ARC is the second level of the ZFS caching "
"system. The primary ARC is stored in RAM. Since the amount of available RAM "
"is often limited, ZFS can also use <<zfs-term-vdev-cache,cache vdevs>>. "
"Solid State Disks (SSDs) are often used as these cache devices due to their "
"higher speed and lower latency compared to traditional spinning disks. L2ARC "
"is entirely optional, but having one will significantly increase read speeds "
"for files that are cached on the SSD instead of having to be read from the "
"regular disks. L2ARC can also speed up <<zfs-term-deduplication,"
"deduplication>> because a DDT that does not fit in RAM but does fit in the "
"L2ARC will be much faster than a DDT that must be read from disk. The rate "
"at which data is added to the cache devices is limited to prevent "
"prematurely wearing out SSDs with too many writes. Until the cache is full "
"(the first block has been evicted to make room), writing to the L2ARC is "
"limited to the sum of the write limit and the boost limit, and afterwards "
"limited to the write limit. A pair of man:sysctl[8] values control these "
"rate limits. <<zfs-advanced-tuning-l2arc_write_max,`vfs.zfs."
"l2arc_write_max`>> controls how many bytes are written to the cache per "
"second, while <<zfs-advanced-tuning-l2arc_write_boost,`vfs.zfs."
"l2arc_write_boost`>> adds to this limit during the \"Turbo Warmup Phase"
"\" (Write Boost).  |[[zfs-term-zil]]ZIL |ZIL accelerates synchronous "
"transactions by using storage devices like SSDs that are faster than those "
"used in the main storage pool. When an application requests a synchronous "
"write (a guarantee that the data has been safely stored to disk rather than "
"merely cached to be written later), the data is written to the faster ZIL "
"storage, then later flushed out to the regular disks. This greatly reduces "
"latency and improves performance. Only synchronous workloads like databases "
"will benefit from a ZIL. Regular asynchronous writes such as copying files "
"will not use the ZIL at all.  |[[zfs-term-cow]]Copy-On-Write |Unlike a "
"traditional file system, when data is overwritten on ZFS, the new data is "
"written to a different block rather than overwriting the old data in place. "
"Only when this write is complete is the metadata then updated to point to "
"the new location. In the event of a shorn write (a system crash or power "
"loss in the middle of writing a file), the entire original contents of the "
"file are still available and the incomplete write is discarded. This also "
"means that ZFS does not require a man:fsck[8] after an unexpected shutdown.  "
"|[[zfs-term-dataset]]Dataset |_Dataset_ is the generic term for a ZFS file "
"system, volume, snapshot or clone. Each dataset has a unique name in the "
"format _poolname/path@snapshot_. The root of the pool is technically a "
"dataset as well. Child datasets are named hierarchically like directories. "
"For example, _mypool/home_, the home dataset, is a child of _mypool_ and "
"inherits properties from it. This can be expanded further by creating "
"_mypool/home/user_. This grandchild dataset will inherit properties from the "
"parent and grandparent. Properties on a child can be set to override the "
"defaults inherited from the parents and grandparents. Administration of "
"datasets and their children can be <<zfs-zfs-allow,delegated>>.  |[[zfs-term-"
"filesystem]]File system |A ZFS dataset is most often used as a file system. "
"Like most other file systems, a ZFS file system is mounted somewhere in the "
"systems directory hierarchy and contains files and directories of its own "
"with permissions, flags, and other metadata.  |[[zfs-term-volume]]Volume |In "
"addition to regular file system datasets, ZFS can also create volumes, which "
"are block devices. Volumes have many of the same features, including copy-on-"
"write, snapshots, clones, and checksumming. Volumes can be useful for "
"running other file system formats on top of ZFS, such as UFS virtualization, "
"or exporting iSCSI extents.  |[[zfs-term-snapshot]]Snapshot |The <<zfs-term-"
"cow,copy-on-write>> (COW) design of ZFS allows for nearly instantaneous, "
"consistent snapshots with arbitrary names. After taking a snapshot of a "
"dataset, or a recursive snapshot of a parent dataset that will include all "
"child datasets, new data is written to new blocks, but the old blocks are "
"not reclaimed as free space. The snapshot contains the original version of "
"the file system, and the live file system contains any changes made since "
"the snapshot was taken. No additional space is used. As new data is written "
"to the live file system, new blocks are allocated to store this data. The "
"apparent size of the snapshot will grow as the blocks are no longer used in "
"the live file system, but only in the snapshot. These snapshots can be "
"mounted read only to allow for the recovery of previous versions of files. "
"It is also possible to <<zfs-zfs-snapshot,rollback>> a live file system to a "
"specific snapshot, undoing any changes that took place after the snapshot "
"was taken. Each block in the pool has a reference counter which keeps track "
"of how many snapshots, clones, datasets, or volumes make use of that block. "
"As files and snapshots are deleted, the reference count is decremented. When "
"a block is no longer referenced, it is reclaimed as free space. Snapshots "
"can also be marked with a <<zfs-zfs-snapshot,hold>>. When a snapshot is "
"held, any attempt to destroy it will return an `EBUSY` error. Each snapshot "
"can have multiple holds, each with a unique name. The <<zfs-zfs-snapshot,"
"release>> command removes the hold so the snapshot can deleted. Snapshots "
"can be taken on volumes, but they can only be cloned or rolled back, not "
"mounted independently.  |[[zfs-term-clone]]Clone |Snapshots can also be "
"cloned. A clone is a writable version of a snapshot, allowing the file "
"system to be forked as a new dataset. As with a snapshot, a clone initially "
"consumes no additional space. As new data is written to a clone and new "
"blocks are allocated, the apparent size of the clone grows. When blocks are "
"overwritten in the cloned file system or volume, the reference count on the "
"previous block is decremented. The snapshot upon which a clone is based "
"cannot be deleted because the clone depends on it. The snapshot is the "
"parent, and the clone is the child. Clones can be _promoted_, reversing this "
"dependency and making the clone the parent and the previous parent the "
"child. This operation requires no additional space. Since the amount of "
"space used by the parent and child is reversed, existing quotas and "
"reservations might be affected.  |[[zfs-term-checksum]]Checksum |Every block "
"that is allocated is also checksummed. The checksum algorithm used is a per-"
"dataset property, see <<zfs-zfs-set,`set`>>. The checksum of each block is "
"transparently validated as it is read, allowing ZFS to detect silent "
"corruption. If the data that is read does not match the expected checksum, "
"ZFS will attempt to recover the data from any available redundancy, like "
"mirrors or RAID-Z. Validation of all checksums can be triggered with <<zfs-"

"corruption, but it does not protect the pool from the loss of an entire "
"disk.  |[[zfs-term-deduplication]]Deduplication |Checksums make it possible "
"to detect duplicate blocks of data as they are written. With deduplication, "
"the reference count of an existing, identical block is increased, saving "
"storage space. To detect duplicate blocks, a deduplication table (DDT) is "
"kept in memory. The table contains a list of unique checksums, the location "
"of those blocks, and a reference count. When new data is written, the "
"checksum is calculated and compared to the list. If a match is found, the "
"existing block is used. The SHA256 checksum algorithm is used with "
"deduplication to provide a secure cryptographic hash. Deduplication is "
"tunable. If `dedup` is `on`, then a matching checksum is assumed to mean "
"that the data is identical. If `dedup` is set to `verify`, then the data in "
"the two blocks will be checked byte-for-byte to ensure it is actually "
"identical. If the data is not identical, the hash collision will be noted "
"and the two blocks will be stored separately. As DDT must store the hash of "
"each unique block, it consumes a very large amount of memory. A general rule "
"of thumb is 5-6 GB of ram per 1 TB of deduplicated data). In situations "
"where it is not practical to have enough RAM to keep the entire DDT in "
"memory, performance will suffer greatly as the DDT must be read from disk "
"before each new block is written. Deduplication can use L2ARC to store the "
"DDT, providing a middle ground between fast system memory and slower disks. "
"Consider using compression instead, which often provides nearly as much "

"any corrupted blocks before they are needed. A scrub is not required after "
"an unclean shutdown, but is recommended at least once every three months. "
"The checksum of each block is verified as blocks are read during normal use, "

"silent corruption. Data security is improved, especially in archival storage "

"devices exceeds the level of redundancy in the vdev. If missing devices can "
"be reconnected, the pool will return to an <<zfs-term-online,Online>> state. "
"If there is insufficient redundancy to compensate for the number of failed "
"disks, then the contents of the pool are lost and must be restored from "
"backups."
