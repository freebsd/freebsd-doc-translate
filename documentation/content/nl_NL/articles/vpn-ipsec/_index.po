"Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a set of protocols which sit on top of "
"the Internet Protocol (IP) layer.  It allows two or more hosts to "
"communicate in a secure manner by authenticating and encrypting each IP "
"packet of a communication session.  The FreeBSD IPsec network stack is based "
"on the http://www.kame.net/[http://www.kame.net/] implementation and "
"supports both IPv4 and IPv6 sessions."
