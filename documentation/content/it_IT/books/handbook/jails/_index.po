"Since system administration is a difficult task, many tools have been "

"_jails_.  Jails have been available since FreeBSD 4.X and continue to be "

"Jails build upon the man:chroot[2] concept, which is used to change the root "
"directory of a set of processes.  This creates a safe environment, separate "
"from the rest of the system.  Processes created in the chrooted environment "
"can not access files or resources outside of it.  For that reason, "
"compromising a service running in a chrooted environment should not allow "
"the attacker to compromise the entire system."

"However, a chroot has several limitations.  It is suited to easy tasks which "

"many ways have been found to escape from a chrooted environment, making it a "

"In a traditional chroot environment, processes are only limited in the part "
"of the file system they can access.  The rest of the system resources, "
"system users, running processes, and the networking subsystem are shared by "
"the chrooted processes and the processes of the host system.  Jails expand "
"this model by virtualizing access to the file system, the set of users, and "
"the networking subsystem.  More fine-grained controls are available for "
"tuning the access of a jailed environment.  Jails can be considered as a "
"type of operating system-level virtualization."
msgstr ""
"Le carceri migliorano il concetto dell'ambiente chroot tradizionale in "
"diversi modi. In un ambiente chroot tradizionale, i processi sono limitati "
"solo nella parte del file system a cui possono accedere. Il resto delle "
"risorse di sistema, gli utenti del sistema, i processi in esecuzione e il "
"sottosistema di rete sono condivisi dai processi chroot e dai processi del "
"sistema host. Le jail espandono questo modello virtualizzando l'accesso al "
"file system, al set di utenti e al sottosistema di rete. Sono disponibili "
"controlli più dettagliati per ottimizzare l'accesso di un ambiente "
"imprigionato. Le jail possono essere considerate come un tipo di "
"virtualizzazione a livello di sistema operativo."
