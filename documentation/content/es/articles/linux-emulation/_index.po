"This masters thesis deals with updating the Linux(R) emulation layer (the so "
"called _Linuxulator_).  The task was to update the layer to match the "
"functionality of Linux(R) 2.6.  As a reference implementation, the Linux(R) "
"2.6.16 kernel was chosen.  The concept is loosely based on the NetBSD "
"implementation.  Most of the work was done in the summer of 2006 as a part "
"of the Google Summer of Code students program.  The focus was on bringing "
"the _NPTL_ (new POSIX(R) thread library) support into the emulation layer, "
"including _TLS_ (thread local storage), _futexes_ (fast user space mutexes), "
"_PID mangling_, and some other minor things.  Many small problems were "
"identified and fixed in the process.  My work was integrated into the main "
"FreeBSD source repository and will be shipped in the upcoming 7.0R release.  "
"We, the emulation development team, are working on making the Linux(R) 2.6 "
"emulation the default emulation layer in FreeBSD."

"UNIX(R) is an operating system with a long history that has influenced "
"almost every other operating system currently in use.  Starting in the "
"1960s, its development continues to this day (although in different "
"projects).  UNIX(R) development soon forked into two main ways: the BSDs and "
"System III/V families.  They mutually influenced themselves by growing a "
"common UNIX(R) standard.  Among the contributions originated in BSD we can "
"name virtual memory, TCP/IP networking, FFS, and many others.  The System V "
"branch contributed to SysV interprocess communication primitives, copy-on-"
"write, etc.  UNIX(R) itself does not exist any more but its ideas have been "
"used by many other operating systems world wide thus forming the so called "
"UNIX(R)-like operating systems.  These days the most influential ones are "
"Linux(R), Solaris, and possibly (to some extent) FreeBSD.  There are in-"
"company UNIX(R) derivatives (AIX, HP-UX etc.), but these have been more and "
"more migrated to the aforementioned systems.  Let us summarize typical "
"UNIX(R) characteristics."

"Looking from an implementation point of view, there are two main approaches "

"emulation does not require any special conditions and basically can be "

"emulation layer but simply reversing of the printed text is sufficient.  "

"necessary condition is that the two environments must be similar enough.  "
"The third approach combines the two previous.  Most of the time the objects "

"obvio que no hay necesidad de una capa de emulación compleja, pero basta con "
"invertir el texto impreso. A veces, el entorno de emulación es muy similar "

"mucho menos exigente de implementar, por lo que consume menos tiempo y es "

"que los dos entornos sean lo suficientemente similares. El tercer enfoque "

"Atomic operations are implemented through a set of functions performing "
"simple arithmetics on memory operands in an atomic way with respect to "
"external events (interrupts, preemption, etc.).  Atomic operations can "
"guarantee atomicity just on small data types (in the magnitude order of the "
"`.long.` architecture C data type), so should be rarely used directly in the "
"end-level code, if not only for very simple operations (like flag setting in "
"a bitmap, for example).  In fact, it is rather simple and common to write "
"down a wrong semantic based on just atomic operations (usually referred as "
"lock-less).  The FreeBSD kernel offers a way to perform atomic operations in "
"conjunction with a memory barrier.  The memory barriers will guarantee that "
"an atomic operation will happen following some specified ordering with "
"respect to other memory accesses.  For example, if we need that an atomic "
"operation happen just after all other pending writes (in terms of "
"instructions reordering buffers activities) are completed, we need to "
"explicitly use a memory barrier in conjunction to this atomic operation.  So "
"it is simple to understand why memory barriers play a key role for higher-"
"level locks building (just as refcounts, mutexes, etc.).  For a detailed "
"explanatory on atomic operations, please refer to man:atomic[9].  It is far, "
"however, noting that atomic operations (and memory barriers as well) should "
"ideally only be used for building front-ending locks (as mutexes)."

"Las operaciones atómicas se implementan a través de un conjunto de funciones "
"que realizan aritmética simple sobre operandos de memoria de forma atómica "
"con respecto a eventos externos (interrupciones, apropiación, etc.). Las "
"operaciones atómicas pueden garantizar la atomicidad solo en tipos de datos "
"pequeños (en el orden de magnitud del <literal>.long.</literal>tipo de datos "
"de arquitectura C), por lo que rara vez se debe usar directamente en el "
"código de nivel final, si no solo para operaciones muy simples (como la "
"configuración de banderas en un mapa de bits, por ejemplo). De hecho, es "
"bastante simple y común escribir una semántica incorrecta basada solo en "
"operaciones atómicas (generalmente referidas como sin bloqueo). El kernel de "
"FreeBSD ofrece una forma de realizar operaciones atómicas junto con una "
"barrera de memoria. Las barreras de memoria garantizarán que ocurra una "
"operación atómica siguiendo un orden específico con respecto a otros accesos "
"a la memoria. Por ejemplo, si necesitamos que ocurra una operación atómica "
"justo después de que se completen todas las demás escrituras pendientes (en "
"términos de instrucciones que reordenan las actividades de búfer), "
"necesitamos usar explícitamente una barrera de memoria junto con esta "
"operación atómica. Por lo tanto, es sencillo entender por qué las barreras "
"de memoria juegan un papel clave para la construcción de bloqueos de nivel "
"superior (como refcounts, mutexes, etc.). Para obtener una explicación "
"detallada sobre las operaciones atómicas, consulte "
"<citerefentry><refentrytitle>atomic</refentrytitle><manvolnum>9</manvolnum></"
"citerefentry>. Sin embargo, está lejos de señalar que las operaciones "
"atómicas (y las barreras de memoria también) deberían idealmente usarse solo "

"Threads in computer science are entities within a process that can be "
"scheduled independently from each other.  The threads in the process share "
"process wide data (file descriptors, etc.) but also have their own stack for "
"their own data.  Sometimes there is a need for process-wide data specific to "
"a given thread.  Imagine a name of the thread in execution or something like "
"that.  The traditional UNIX(R) threading API, pthreads provides a way to do "
"it via man:pthread_key_create[3], man:pthread_setspecific[3] and man:"
"pthread_getspecific[3] where a thread can create a key to the thread local "
"data and using man:pthread_getspecific[3] or man:pthread_getspecific[3] to "
"manipulate those data.  You can easily see that this is not the most "
"comfortable way this could be accomplished.  So various producers of C/C++ "
"compilers introduced a better way.  They defined a new modifier keyword "
"thread that specifies that a variable is thread specific.  A new method of "
"accessing such variables was developed as well (at least on i386).  The "
"pthreads method tends to be implemented in userspace as a trivial lookup "
"table.  The performance of such a solution is not very good.  So the new "
"method uses (on i386) segment registers to address a segment, where TLS area "
"is stored so the actual accessing of a thread variable is just appending the "
"segment register to the address thus addressing via it.  The segment "
"registers are usually `%gs` and `%fs` acting like segment selectors.  Every "
"thread has its own area where the thread local data are stored and the "
"segment must be loaded on every context switch.  This method is very fast "
"and used almost exclusively in the whole i386 UNIX(R) world.  Both FreeBSD "
"and Linux(R) implement this approach and it yields very good results.  The "
"only drawback is the need to reload the segment on every context switch "
"which can slowdown context switches.  FreeBSD tries to avoid this overhead "
"by using only 1 segment descriptor for this while Linux(R) uses 3.  "
"Interesting thing is that almost nothing uses more than 1 descriptor (only "
"Wine seems to use 2) so Linux(R) pays this unnecessary price for context "
"switches."

"The ioctl interface is quite fragile due to its generality.  We have to bear "

"implemented in [.filename]#linux_ioctl.c#, where `linux_ioctl` function is "
"defined.  This function simply iterates over sets of ioctl handlers to find "
"a handler that implements a given command.  The ioctl syscall has three "
"parameters, the file descriptor, command and an argument.  The command is a "
"16-bit number, which in theory is divided into high 8 bits determining class "
