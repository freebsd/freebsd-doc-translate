"This means that a port must not install files directly to the regular "
"destination directories (that is, under `PREFIX`, for example) but instead "
"into a separate directory from which the package is then built.  In many "
"cases, this does not require root privileges, making it possible to build "
"packages as an unprivileged user.  With staging, the port is built and "

"the stage directory and then installed on the system. Automake tools refer "
