"Most modern computer systems use a stack to pass arguments to procedures and "
"to store local variables. A stack is a last in first out (LIFO) buffer in "
"the high memory area of a process image. When a program invokes a function a "
"new \"stack frame\" is created. This stack frame consists of the arguments "
"passed to the function as well as a dynamic amount of local variable "
"space. The \"stack pointer\" is a register that holds the current location "
"of the top of the stack. Since this value is constantly changing as new "
"values are pushed onto the top of the stack, many implementations also "
"provide a \"frame pointer\" that is located near the beginning of a stack "
"frame so that local variables can more easily be addressed relative to this "
"value. <<cod,1>> The return address for function calls is also stored on the "
"stack, and this is the cause of stack-overflow exploits since overflowing a "
"local variable in a function can overwrite the return address of that "
"function, potentially allowing a malicious user to execute any code he or "
"she wants."

"The most straightforward solution to the problem of stack-overflows is to "
"always use length restricted memory and string copy functions. `strncpy` and "
"`strncat` are part of the standard C library.  These functions accept a "
"length value as a parameter which should be no larger than the size of the "
"destination buffer. These functions will then copy up to 'length' bytes from "
"the source to the destination. However there are a number of problems with "
"these functions. Neither function guarantees NUL termination if the size of "
"the input buffer is as large as the destination. The length parameter is "
"also used inconsistently between strncpy and strncat so it is easy for "
"programmers to get confused as to their proper usage. There is also a "
"significant performance loss compared to `strcpy` when copying a short "
"string into a large buffer since `strncpy` NUL fills up the size specified."
