"control the configuration of the machine: `-c` controls the number of "
"virtual CPUs, `-m` limits the amount of memory available to the guest, `-t` "
"defines which [.filename]#tap# device to use, `-d` indicates which disk "
"image to use, `-i` tells bhyve to boot from the CD image instead of the "
"disk, and `-I` defines which CD image to use. The last parameter is the name "
"of the virtual machine, used to track the running machines. This example "
