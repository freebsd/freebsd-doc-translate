"Up until now, the FreeBSD project has released a number of described "

"summarising how the project is structured is needed because of the "

"Brooks' law that adding another person to a late project will make it later "
"since it will increase the communication needs . A project model is a tool "

"evolve together with the project so that it can at any point in time reflect "
