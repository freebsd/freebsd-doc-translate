"However, it is not an emulator in the traditional sense.  Many of these "

"the package:emulators/qemu[] port) operates in this way.  One of the "
"benefits of this approach is the ability to install a full version of the OS "
"in question to the emulator.  It means that the environment will not look "
"any different to applications than a real machine, and chances are good that "
"everything will work on it.  The downside to this approach is the fact that "
"software acting as hardware is inherently slower than actual hardware.  The "
"computer built in software (called the _guest_) requires resources from the "
"real machine (the _host_), and holds on to those resources for as long as it "
"is running."

"benefícios dessa abordagem é a habilidade de instalar uma versão completa do "
"SO em contraponto ao emulador. Isso significa que o ambiente não parecerá "
"diferente de uma maquina real para as aplicações, e as chances são boas que "
"tudo irá funcionar nele. O ponto fraco dessa abordagem é o fato que o "
"software atuando como hardware é inerentemente mais lento que o hardware "
