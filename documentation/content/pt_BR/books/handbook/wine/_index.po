"However, it is not an emulator in the traditional sense.  Many of these "

"software processes in place of hardware.  Virtualization (such as that "
"provided by the package:emulators/qemu[] port) operates in this way.  One of "
"the benefits of this approach is the ability to install a full version of "
"the OS in question to the emulator.  It means that the environment will not "
"look any different to applications than a real machine, and chances are good "
"that everything will work on it.  The downside to this approach is the fact "
"that software acting as hardware is inherently slower than actual hardware.  "
"The computer built in software (called the _guest_) requires resources from "
"the real machine (the _host_), and holds on to those resources for as long "
"as it is running."

"benefícios dessa abordagem é a habilidade de instalar uma versão completa do "
"SO em contraponto ao emulador. Isso significa que o ambiente não parecerá "
"diferente de uma maquina real para as aplicações, e as chances são boas que "
"tudo irá funcionar nele. O ponto fraco dessa abordagem é o fato que o "
"software atuando como hardware é inerentemente mais lento que o hardware "
