"Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) often develop a reference design for "

"companies refine the design, market the product to their target audience or "
"geographic area, and put their own name plate onto the card. The refinements "
"to the physical card are typically very minor, if any changes are made at "
"all. To strengthen their brand, these vendors place their company name in "

"Due to this practice, FreeBSD drivers usually rely on numeric IDs for device "

"made the card might already have a different manufacturer ID listed in the "
"central database. Linksys, D-Link, and NetGear are a number of US "
