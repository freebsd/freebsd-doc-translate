"to other CPU's or devices if the write to release the lock is visible. The "
"CPU is free to keep that data in its cache or store buffer as long as it "

"The first trade-off is that the preemption code does not take other CPUs "

"thread as 4 and the priority of B's thread as 2. If CPU B makes a thread "
"with priority 1 runnable, then in theory, we want CPU A to switch to the new "
"thread so that we will be running the two highest priority runnable threads. "
"However, the cost of determining which CPU to enforce a preemption on as "
"well as actually signaling that CPU via an IPI along with the "
"synchronization that would be required would be enormous. Thus, the current "
"code would instead force CPU B to switch to the higher priority thread. Note "
"that this still puts the system in a better position as CPU B is executing a "
"thread of priority 1 rather than a thread of priority 2."

"may switch out the executing thread just before it is about to sleep or "
"execute. The cache on the CPU must then adjust to the new thread. When the "
"kernel returns to the preempted thread, it must refill all the cache "

"performed that could be avoided if the kernel deferred the preemption until "
"the first thread blocked or returned to userland. Thus, by default, the "

"第二处折衷是限制对于实时优先级的内核线程的立即抢占。在前面所定义的抢占操作的"
