"The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a new way of attaching devices to personal "
"computers. The bus architecture features two-way communication and has been "
"developed as a response to devices becoming smarter and requiring more "
"interaction with the host. USB support is included in all current PC "
"chipsets and is therefore available in all recently built PCs. Apple's "
"introduction of the USB-only iMac has been a major incentive for hardware "
"manufacturers to produce USB versions of their devices. The future PC "
"specifications specify that all legacy connectors on PCs should be replaced "
"by one or more USB connectors, providing generic plug and play capabilities. "
"Support for USB hardware was available at a very early stage in NetBSD and "
"was developed by Lennart Augustsson for the NetBSD project. The code has "
"been ported to FreeBSD and we are currently maintaining a shared code base. "
"For the implementation of the USB subsystem a number of features of USB are "
"important."
