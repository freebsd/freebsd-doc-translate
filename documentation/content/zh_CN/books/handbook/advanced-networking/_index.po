"_Routing_ is the mechanism that allows a system to find the network path to "
"another system.  A _route_ is a defined pair of addresses which represent "
"the \"destination\" and a \"gateway\".  The route indicates that when trying "
"to get to the specified destination, send the packets through the specified "
"gateway.  There are three types of destinations: individual hosts, subnets, "
"and \"default\".  The \"default route\" is used if no other routes apply.  "
"There are also three types of gateways: individual hosts, interfaces, also "
"called links, and Ethernet hardware (MAC) addresses.  Known routes are "
"stored in a routing table."
