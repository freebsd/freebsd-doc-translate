"However, it is not an emulator in the traditional sense.  Many of these "

"the benefits of this approach is the ability to install a full version of "
"the OS in question to the emulator.  It means that the environment will not "
"look any different to applications than a real machine, and chances are good "
"that everything will work on it.  The downside to this approach is the fact "
"that software acting as hardware is inherently slower than actual hardware.  "
