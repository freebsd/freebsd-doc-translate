"The rapid pace of FreeBSD progress makes print media impractical as a means "
"of following the latest developments.  Electronic resources are the best, if "
"not often the only, way to stay informed of the latest advances.  Since "
"FreeBSD is a volunteer effort, the user community itself also generally "
"serves as a \"technical support department\" of sorts, with electronic mail, "
