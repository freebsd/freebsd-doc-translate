"Jails build upon the man:chroot[2] concept, which is used to change the root "
"directory of a set of processes.  This creates a safe environment, separate "
"from the rest of the system.  Processes created in the chrooted environment "
"can not access files or resources outside of it.  For that reason, "
"compromising a service running in a chrooted environment should not allow "
"the attacker to compromise the entire system.  However, a chroot has several "
"limitations.  It is suited to easy tasks which do not require much "
"flexibility or complex, advanced features.  Over time, many ways have been "
"found to escape from a chrooted environment, making it a less than ideal "
"solution for securing services."
